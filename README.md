# SNES-Final-Fantasy-Battle-Engine---Python-Project
This is the source code for the SNES Final Fantasy Battle Engine project.  Things are still not complete and there are bugs.  Feel free to improve and enhance the code :)

## What you need:
You need the latest version of pygame to run this engine. To install simply have python installed on your machine and run the command line:

> pip install pygame

Furthermore, you need to download the assets separately (since it is pretty big) and extract it and place the "resources" folder in the same folder as the code. Download here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1i1Xq2aBthlg4nKcZSfy46C_q3_UseQsm/view?usp=sharing

## To Do List:
* Fix item text display when using items.  
	Currently Revive doesn't clear itself when the player expends all uses. (in-progress)
* Add custom abilities tailored per each character (in-progress) (added specials) (adding skills next)
* Add enemy formations
* Greatly overhaul and enhance enemy AI (instead of just attacking mindlessly) (50% done)
* Introduce buffs and statuses (in-progress) (done)
* Add grey magic (done)
* Improve the current text engine (very basic at the moment)
* Add character growth system
* Add exp system
* Add multi-target functionality (in-progress) (done for specials)

After Battle System v0.0.6 is finished, implement the character menu.
